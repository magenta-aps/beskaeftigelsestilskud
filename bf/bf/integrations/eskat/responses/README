The file `data_models.py` is autogenerated, and can be regenerated following this procedure:

1) Retrieve the Swagger 2.0 spec for the eSkat REST API at https://eskattest/eTaxCommonDataApi/swagger/docs/v1

This requires:
- an active VPN connection to attavik.nanoq.gl
- mapping "10.240.79.31" to "eskattest" in /etc/hosts
- authenticating using your Nanoq username and password

For your convenience, the Swagger 2.0 spec is checked in to the repo as `swagger_spec.json`.

2) Convert the Swagger 2.0 spec to OpenAPI 3.0 format

$ cd ./bf/bf/integrations/eskat/responses
$ python -mhttp.server &  # serve this folder on http://localhost:8000
$ docker run --network=host --rm -v ${PWD}:/usr/src/app mermade/swagger2openapi swagger2openapi --yaml --outfile openapi_spec.yaml http://localhost:8000/swagger_spec.json

For your convenience, the OpenAPI 3.0 spec is checked in to the repo as `openapi_spec.yaml`.

3) Generate `data_models.py`

$ docker compose exec bf bash -c "/app/bf/integrations/eskat/responses/build_data_models.sh"

This should build a new `data_models.py` in the `./bf/bf/integrations/eskat/responses/` directory.

For your convenience, a pre-built `data_models.py` is checked in to the repo.
